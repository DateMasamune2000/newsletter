# newsletter

This is a simple program that creates a newsletter. It was inspired by
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk8q7MNeWeQ&pp=ygUUcGhwIG5ld3NsZXR0ZXIgcHJpbnTSBwkJrQkBhyohjO8%3D)

It works by making a request to an RSS feed, and then caching the results to
a file so it does not have to make a request again.

## Usage

```
main.pl
```

This program currently has no options, but some are planned (see "current
issues" section)

## Current Issues

- [ ] No option to override cache and fetch latest feeds
